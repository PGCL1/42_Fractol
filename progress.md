							**FRACTOL**


DONE:
	- created keyhooks for exiting the window
	- created function where mandelbrot Mandelbrot or 1 can be passed as parameters or even MandeLbrot and do so for all the next fractals
	- created keyhooks for move the image with keys A S D W and arrows and added incrementing proportionally during zooming
	- created the zoom functions
	- created the colors shading for the fractal depending on n iterations
	- create the Julia set
	- create julia set with increments in c (need to rethink structures)
	- create atof for char to double to be able to parse the numbers for the julia set


STUFF FOR TODAY:
	- create the zoom to follow the mouse (linear interpolation)
	- polish multibrot as the current function is not the desired shape
	- look for errors in the arguments check in main
	- var.fractal.height_y is the same as var.mlx.height_y		CHANGE IT (take away var.fractal.width/height)
	- var.fractal.width_x is the same as var.mlx.width_x		CHANGE IT (take away var.fractal.width/height)




IMPROVEMENTS:
	- need to rewrite Makefile in libft/
