							**FRACTOL**


DONE:
	- created keyhooks for exiting the window
	- created function where mandelbrot Mandelbrot or 1 can be passed as parameters or even MandeLbrot and do so for all the next fractals
	- created keyhooks for move the image with keys A S D W and arrows and added incrementing proportionally during zooming
	- created the zoom functions
	- created the colors shading for the fractal depending on n iterations
	- create the Julia set


STUFF FOR TODAY:
	- create the zoom to follow the mouse (linear interpolation)
	- create a second image to smooth out the rendering
	- create julia set with increments in c (need to rethink structures)
	- polish multibrot as the current function is not the desired shape
	- find out to sleep the banner in makefile





IMPROVEMENTS:
	- need to rewrite Makefile in libft/


ERRORS:
