							**FRACTOL**


DONE:
	- created keyhooks for exiting the window
	- created function where mandelbrot Mandelbrot or 1 can be passed as parameters or even MandeLbrot and do so for all the next fractals
	- created keyhooks for move the image with keys A S D W and arrows and added incrementing proportionally during zooming
	- created the zoom functions
	- created different shading


STUFF FOR TODAY:
	- create the colors shading for the fractal depending on n iterations
	- program the zoom to follow the mouse
	- create the Julia set




IMPROVEMENTS:
	- need to rewrite Makefile in libft/
